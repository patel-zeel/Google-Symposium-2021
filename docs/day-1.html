<p>Jay divided his presentation in three topics</p>
<div id="patterns-of-progress-in-ai" class="section level3" number="2.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Patterns of progress in AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>End-to-end ML techniques result in practically best models in almost all the domains (e.g. heath care, speech recognition, vision based robotics, self-driving vehicles, games, agriculture, weather forecasting).</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe it allows to use some mathematical shortcuts underlying the phenomena.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reusable blocks of ML (e.g. Tensorflow, PyTorch) allow to quickly build upon it and connect with the other pipe-lines.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recurrence is closely related to deep part of DL yet it does not work well. This is a contradiction or a paradox</p></li>
<li><p>Very little has changed in terms of fundamental blocks of DL. Researchers must look at this as there is much room for improvement at the fundamental levels.</p></li>
<li><p>Another example of reusability is transfer learning using BERT models</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Model capacity and compute has grown way faster than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s law</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>TPU is able to work fast because of lower precision computation</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Potential technology inflation point: <strong>Quantum Computing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Quantum processors can execute exponentially complex tasks in linear time</p></li>
<li><p>A challenge of noise exists, but can be tackled in future by self-error-correcting mechanism using large number of qubits.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Future of artificial general intelligence (AGI)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Including world knowledge in models that are grounded in reality would work well.</li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/helping-keep-people-safe-ai-enabled-flood-forecasting/">Flood warning system by Google</a></p></li>
<li><p>Sharing fields on which Google India is working on Google level as well as societal level.</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.4</span> Q&amp;A</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Q: How would one balance between breadth and depth as a PhD student?</p>
<p>A: Jay told he started as a machine learning and vision guy 15 years back. After that, he forced himself every two-three years to learn a new field at a complexity level of practitioner of that field. He felt that summarizing all the domains, the number of core problems being solved are really small. Just because of different names and slightly different ways they look very different. Thus, he advised to first get grounded in one field at nuts and bolts level and then it would force one to make connections among various fields which is also a good recipe of building a good career.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: What are the expectations from a PhD students who wants to join the research industry? Where should one focus in last years of PhD? How different is reasearch in industry than academia?</p>
<p>A: Answering the last question first, industry focuses on four pillars (patterns observed in successful researches): i) fundamental research; ii) Building infrastructure; iii) Taking product to larger user base; iv) new product renovation. Answering the other questions, one should be able to summarize what they know in different fields. Jay recalls his adviser’s advise that one should be able to summarize a paper in 3-5 sentences. Jay also builds a corollary on top of it that one should write papers one would not be able to summarize in 3-5 sentences.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: How to explain end-to-end models? Does Google use something specifically for explainability of models?</p>
<p>A: Most models are black-box nowadays and we also have black-box methods to probe them (pointing to gradient propagation and uncertainty propagation methods). What happens in between (exact mathematics) is of least concern as long as one is able to reason the output based on particular inputs (e.g. which part of a medical image drove the decision made by an AI model?)</p></li>
<li><p>Q: As the models parameters are growing into millions we need to scale hardwares (GPUs and TPUs) at the same pace. This might be bottleneck after some time. What are your views on this?</p>
<p>A: Jay has two answers for this question. First is, having a small GPU cluster at university level is not that expensive and it is enough to do meaningful experiments that can scale in practice. Secondly, Jay believes he would not be surprised if few years from now we discover that we were unnecessarily wasting a lot of compute and there are clever mathematical tricks (nearest neighbor searching, branch and bound) to do the task efficiently.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: Most ML models learn with back-propogation but human brain does not seem to learn that way. How to closely mimic human brain learning for AGI (artificial general intelligence)?</p>
<p>A: Jay does not think it is an requirement for AGI (quoting airoplanes don’t flap their wings philosophy). He feels that taking inspiration from nature is good but one has to stay within the limits of what machines can do.</p></li>
